# Project Description
The objective of this project is to predict cryptocurrency price trends using historical data, including volatility, trading volume, and technical indicators. The project employs machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM to build a robust predictive system. The focus is on feature engineering, model selection, and performance optimization through techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and validation strategies.

# steps
Step 1: Data Collection
Description: Collect historical data for cryptocurrencies. Data should include price, trading volume, etc over a defined period. Frequency (daily)
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Identify any missing data points in the collected dataset. Handle missing values using interpolation, forward fill, or backward fill to ensure data continuity.
Normalization: Scale the data using normalization techniques such as Min-Max Scaler or StandardScaler to bring all features to a uniform scale, improving model convergence and performance.
Step 3: Feature Engineering
Technical Indicators: Calculate technical indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to capture market trends, momentum, and potential reversals.
Historical Volatility (HV): Compute the historical volatility using rolling window methods on the closing prices to quantify the price variation over time. This is an essential feature for capturing the market's risk level.
Step 4: Data Preparation for Modeling
Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the time series order to avoid data leakage. Typically, use an 80-20 split.
Model Preparation Functions: Create functions or utilities to generate inputs for various machine learning models. For RNN and LSTM models, use sequences of past data points to predict future values.
Step 5: Model Selection
RNN and LSTM Models: Focus on selecting appropriate models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTM models are especially suited for time series data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and trends.
Step 6: Hyperparameter Tuning
Description: Optimize the modelâ€™s hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, units, dropout rates, learning rate, and batch size. This step is computationally intensive and may require considerable time and resources.
Step 7: Training and Predicting
Model Training: Train the selected models using the prepared datasets. During training, monitor metrics like loss and accuracy to avoid overfitting or underfitting.
Prediction: Use the trained models to predict future cryptocurrency volatility. Evaluate the predicted values to see if they align with actual data.
Step 8: Optimization
Description: Select the best tuned parameters to optimize the performance.
Step 9: Model Evaluation
Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using metrics (R-squared).
Step 10: Reporting and Visualization
Visualization: Use visualization libraries like Matplotlib, or Plotly to visualize the model's predictions against actual values.
Reporting: Document all steps, findings, and results, including the preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, training process, and evaluation metrics, to provide a comprehensive overview of the project.
