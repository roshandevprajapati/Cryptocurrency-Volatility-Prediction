1. More technical Indicators: such as Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator
2. Use of Ensemble models can improve model predictions by reducing Bias
3. Use of techniques like L1/L2 regularization can help penalize overly complex models.
4. Cross-Validation and Model Averaging can prevent overfitting.
5. Additional metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) can help understand the results better.
6. Development of an Automated Pipeline can reduce time for retraining and updating.
